# Crowdfunding Analysis Report

## Overview of Project
    The project oversees the data that is needed to have a better understanding of the crowfunding projects. The main purpose of the analysis is to find out what crowdfund  campaign fared in relation to their launch dates, using the theater category, on one hand, and on the other hand, which plays are fared in relation to its funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    In order to have a better visualization of the outcomes based on their launch date, it has been created a pivot chart:

    As a second part of the analysis, it has been created a line chart, taht ilustrates the outcomes based on goals, taht can be seen below

### At a quick glance of the dataset, we could notice that the outcome could be changed, if the pledged amount could not be reached.

## Results

- First of all, analysing the pivot chart resulted, we could say that the most succesful theater campaigns were lunched in the months of May and June, the month of June having the highest number. At the other end, towards the end of the year, in December having the least successful theater campaigns launched. This makes us state, that launching the fundraising campaign for theater, has a significant outcome if it were to be lunched in the month of June. 
- Secondly, the outcomes based on goals, shows the precentage of how many successful, failed and canceled campaigns in the plays category, using different ranges. We can observe that the highest percentage of the succesful campaigns are the ones that have established the goal of founds under 1000$. Setting a goal between 45000-50000, results in this casea 100 percentage of failed campaigns in the play category.

- The Kickstarter database is very complex, and to have a more detailed report, we could create a pivot table and chart based on the pledged amount, thus analysing the outcomes using as variable the pledged amount.
